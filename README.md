## Usage

### Build

To build the App in mobile, run

```bash
pnpm mobile
```

And you will see the generated file in `dist` that ready to be served.

### Deploy on Netlify

Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start) and select your clone, `OK` along the way, and your App will be live in a minute.


### Development

Start each local server in a separate terminal.

#### Start local Supabase DB

> You need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
> You need to have Supabase CLI (`npm install supabase --save-dev`) installed.

```bash
supabase start
```
Replace in `configs.json`
`supa_anon.local` the key by the one logged in the terminal `anon key`
Run the front with 

#### Start local Supabase Functions

```bash
supabase function serve
```

#### Start local Front

In the second terminal run

```bash
pnpm local-serve
```

#### Login

Visit http://localhost:3334

Use the demo credentials.
Account: test@capgo.app
Password: testtest

This account has some demo data in it.
If the data is not fresh just reset the db with `supabase db reset` the seed has been made in the way the data is always fresh.

The admin account is
Account: admin@capgo.app
Password: adminadmin

This user will be admin so he can impersonate other users.
You can find the menu for that in the account section.
